# The Tutorial Changelog

This changelog is ordered in reverse chronological order, meaning that the last changes made will always be on top of the file, so that readers will not have to scroll all the way down with each change.

## Stage 0: Boilerplate

This branch contains a boilerplate for almost every react app you are going to create.  
This boilerplate consists of:

- Files created by [`npx create-react-app`](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

We will pass the name of our app as an arguments running `npm create-react-app todo-app`.  
We have also created a .gitignore file.

## Stage 1: Hello world

In this stage we have set up our initial structure for our react app.

    - We printed hello world in our main file.
    - We deleted files we don't need.
    - We installed node-sass using npm and we connected it to our app.
