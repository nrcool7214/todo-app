## Things that are going to be done

This file lists the changes that need to be made in each stage. It is ordered in reverse chronological order, meaning that the last changes made will always be on top of the file, so that readers will not have to scroll all the way down with each task added.

## Task 02 - Components

Components let you split the UI into independent, reusable pieces, and think about each piece in isolation. This page provides an introduction to the idea of components. You can find a detailed component API reference [here](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html). Conceptually, components are like JavaScript functions. They accept arbitrary inputs (called “props”) and return React elements describing what should appear on the screen.

But we don't really care about props YET!. In this task we would like to organize our app and build our components. We will design our app, we will break it into components and we will start writing our first components.

**TODO**

1. Create a design of how your app will look. Your app should contain a navigation bar, some space for your todo input form and some space for the finished todos.
2. Implement the design into components.

## Task 01 - Hello World

Here we are. Our journey with React just started and we are about to learn the sh\*t out of it. We have our basic file structure set up, thanks to `create-react-app` and we will dig in to our first task.

**Story**
We will create a simple todo app. We will build all the functionalitis from scratch so the users can be able to add new todos, check and uncheck todos as done and delete them.

**TODO**:

In this task we would like to:

1. Explore the folder structure and the javascript files. What's the entry point of our app? What is this funky html called [JSX](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html)?
2. Let's try to print Hello World to our app, instread of the default message from React.
3. Let's get rid of what we don't need like unused images.
4. I don't see any .scss files around. Let's add one.
